# [Tutorial: Create your first ASP.NET Core MVC app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-6.0)

This tutorial teaches ASP.NET Core MVC web development with controllers and views. If you're new to ASP.NET Core web development, consider the [Razor Pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start?view=aspnetcore-6.0) version of this tutorial, which provides an easier starting point. See [Choose an ASP.NET Core UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/choose-web-ui?view=aspnetcore-6.0), which compares Razor Pages, MVC, and Blazor for UI development.
